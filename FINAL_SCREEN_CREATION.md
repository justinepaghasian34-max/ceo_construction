# Final Screen Creation - All Remaining Files

I'll create all 11 remaining screen files now to resolve all import errors:

## Status: Creating all remaining screens...

This will resolve all the "Target of URI doesn't exist" errors in the app_router.dart file.

After creating these files, I'll also fix the GoRouter 'location' property issues.
